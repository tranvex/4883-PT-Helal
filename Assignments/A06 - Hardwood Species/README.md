## 10226 - Hardwood Species
### Yoseph Helal 
### Description:

Hardwoods are the botanical group of trees that have broad leaves,
produce a fruit or nut, and generally go dormant in the winter.
America's temperate climates produce forests with hundreds of
hardwood species |trees that share certain biological characteris-
tics. Although oak, maple and cherry all are types of hardwood
trees, for example, they are different species. Together, all the hard-
wood species represent 40 percent of the trees in the United States.
On the other hand, softwoods, or conifers, from the Latin word
meaning “cone-bearing”, have needles. Widely available US soft-
woods include cedar, r, hemlock, pine, redwood, spruce and cy-
press. In a home, the softwoods are used primarily as structural
lumber such as 2×4s and 2×6s, with some limited decorative appli-
cations.

Using satellite imaging technology, the Department of Natural Resources has compiled an inventory
of every tree standing on a particular day. You are to compute the total fraction of the tree population
represented by each species.
