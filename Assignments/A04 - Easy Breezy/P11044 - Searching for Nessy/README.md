## 11044 - Searching for Nessy
### Yoseph Helal 
### Description:

Given a grid of n rows and m columns representing the
loch, 6 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000, find the minimum number s of sonar
beams you must put in the square such that we can control
every position in the grid, with the following conditions:
• one sonar occupies one position in the grid; the sonar
beam controls its own cell and the contiguous cells;
• the border cells do not need to be controlled, because
Nessy cannot hide there (she is too big).
