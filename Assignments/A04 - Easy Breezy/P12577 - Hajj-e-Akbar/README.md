## 12577 - Hajj-e-Akbar
### Yoseph Helal 
### Description:

It is generally presumed that the Hajj performed on Friday is called ‘Hajj-e-Akbar’ and it is a
superior kind of Hajj as compared with the Hajj performed on other days of the week.
But, the correct meaning of the term, as explained by a large number of the commentators of the
Holy Quran is that the Umrah, which can be performed at any time throughout the year, was generally
called ‘Hajj-e-Asghar’ (the minor Hajj). In order to distinguish hajj from Umrah the former was named
‘Hajj-e-Akbar’ (the greater hajj). Therefore, each and every hajj is Hajj-e-Akbar, no matter whether
it is performed on Friday or on any other day. The word ‘Akbar’ (greater) is used only to distinguish
it from Umrah which is a minor Hajj.

For each line of the input, output either ‘Hajj-e-Akbar’ or ‘Hajj-e-Asghar’ in separate lines without
quotations. For exact format refer to the sample.
