## 12289 - One-Two-Three
### Yoseph Helal 
### Description:

Your little brother has just learnt to write one, two and three, in English. He has written a lot of those
words in a paper, your task is to recognize them. Note that your little brother is only a child, so he
may make small mistakes: for each word, there might be at most one wrong letter. The word length is
always correct. It is guaranteed that each letter he wrote is in lower-case, and each word he wrote has
a unique interpretation.
